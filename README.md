Elm-Words
=========

A small project written in elm to help my son learn new words.


Tasks
-----
* show a random english word
* spacebar highlights the word (in red ?)
* spacebar highlights each letter in turn
* shift + spacebar goes back (but will not return to before highlighted state)
* then show the word in french (?)
* probably change the model to take in pairs
* fair use images
* tests ? (how could I start with tests next time ?)
* deploy to CF ?
* compare / contrast Html.beginnerProgram with the docs?
