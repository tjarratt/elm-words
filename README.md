Elm-Words
=========

A small webapp written in elm to help my son learn new words.


Tasks
-----
* [x] add "selected" class when advanced is pressed
* [x] button to highlight the word (in red ?)
* [x] second button goes back (but will not return to before highlighted state)
* [x] button highlights each letter in turn
* [x] rapidly simplify the UI
* [x] center the word in the screen
* [x] compare / contrast Html.beginnerProgram with the docs?
* [x] tap / click should advance
* [x] deploy to CF ?
* [ ] then show the word in french
* [ ] fair use images
* [ ] tests ? (how could I start with tests next time ?)
* [ ] show a random english word at startup (?)


Open Questions
--------------
* do we want to track how often the user is correct / wrong ?
* do we want to be able to enter new words ?
* do we want a backend ?
* review notes from elm conference
* try to make it prettier (think about flexbox)


Pain Points
-----------
* having to run `elm css && elm make` after each change
* better emacs mode ?
