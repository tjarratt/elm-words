Elm-Words
=========

A small project written in elm to help my son learn new words.


Completed Tasks
---------------
* show a list of words we want to practice
* show the current word


Tasks
-----
* [x] add "selected" class when advanced is pressed
* [x] button to highlight the word (in red ?)
* [x] second button goes back (but will not return to before highlighted state)
* [x] button highlights each letter in turn
* [x] rapidly simplify the UI
* [x] center the word in the screen
* [ ] tap / click should advance
* [ ] then show the word in french (?)
* [ ] probably change the model to take in pairs
* [ ] fair use images
* [ ] tests ? (how could I start with tests next time ?)
* [ ] deploy to CF ?
* [ ] show a random english word (?)
* [ ] compare / contrast Html.beginnerProgram with the docs?


Open Questions
--------------
* do we want to track how often the user is correct / wrong ?
* do we want to be able to enter new words ?
* review notes from elm conference
* try to make it prettier (think about flexbox)


Pain Points
-----------
* having to run `elm css` after each change
* elm-format
* better emacs mode ?
