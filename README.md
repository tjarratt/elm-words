Elm-Words
=========

A small project written in elm to help my son learn new words.

Completed Tasks
---------------
* show a list of words we want to practice
* show the current word

Tasks
-----
* spacebar highlights the word (in red ?)
* spacebar highlights each letter in turn
* shift + spacebar goes back (but will not return to before highlighted state)
* then show the word in french (?)
* probably change the model to take in pairs
* fair use images
* tests ? (how could I start with tests next time ?)
* deploy to CF ?
* show a random english word (?)
* compare / contrast Html.beginnerProgram with the docs?

Open Questions
--------------
* do we want to track how often he is correct / wrong ?
* do we want to be able to enter new words ?
* review notes from elm conference
